I've included a link for each project that will lead you to my code, documentation, and video demos.

# Cybersecurity

These are all of my projects that pertain to cybersecurity.

## Cryptology

These projects display encryption and decryption processes for several cryptology algorithms. All are coded in Python.

### [HMAC SHA-256](./hmac-sha-256.md)

### [Caesar Shift](./caesar-cryptology.md)
Rotation-based cypher.

### [One Time Pad](./one-time-pad.md)

### [Block Cipher](./block-cipher.md)

# Mobile App Development

Miscellaneous projects that don't have much to do with cybersecurity, but rather me working with utilizing Dart and Flutter to implement functional apps with a GUI.

### [To-do App](./todo-app.md)

### [Personal Finance](./personal-finance.md)
