I've included a link for each project that will lead you to my code, documentation, and video demos (if applicable).

# Cybersecurity

These are all of my projects that pertain to cybersecurity.

## Home Lab

Documenting the process of learning different tools and practices through a VM!

### [SIEM Lab](./siem-lab.md)
I created my own security operations center, utilizing Microsoft Azure and Sentinel to familiarize myself with detecting system traffic and security vulnerabilities.

### [Elastic Dashboard & Visualization Lab](./elastic-lab.md)
I configure different visualizations to illustrate various types of security incidents via the Kibana interface. I use KQL to query for incidents like failed logins, successful RDPs, etc.

### [Active Directory Lab](./active-directory-lab.md)
Here I'm able to get some hands-on experience and familiarity with Active Directory. I'm given a list of tasks and utilize Powershell and the AD GUI to accomplish them.

### [Network Enumeration Lab](./nmap-lab.md)
I'm given three tasks where I use 'nmap' to scan a target, having to bypass firewall rules and be as quiet/efficient as possible.

## Cryptology

These projects present encryption and decryption processes for several cryptology algorithms. All are coded in Python.

### [SHA-256](./sha-256.md)
SHA-256 encryptor, using hashlib documentation.

### [One-Time Pad](./one-time-pad.md)
Encryption with one-time pad algorithm.
Decryption of ciphertext2, when given plaintext1, ciphertext1 and ciphertext2.

### [Caesar Shift](./caesar-cryptology.md)
Rotation-based cypher.

### [Block Cipher](./block-cipher.md)
Encryption and decryption with the Cipher Block Chaining algorithm (CBC).

### [Mini SHA-256 Hash Cracker](./mini-sha256-hash-cracker.md)
Just an extra credit part to my midterm project in Databases & Computer Security. Given a random hash and password length, I'm asked to decrypt it.

# Mobile App Development

Miscellaneous projects that don't have much to do with cybersecurity, but rather me working with utilizing Dart and Flutter to implement functional apps with a GUI.

### [To-do App](./todo-app.md)

### [Personal Finance](./personal-finance.md)
