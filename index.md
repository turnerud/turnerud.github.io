Welcome! My name is Simon Turner, and I'm a senior at the University of Dallas. I'm currently finishing up my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and I intend to begin the MS in Cybersecurity this spring of 2025. 

Here, I'm documenting labs and projects that I've completed to familiarize myself with different tools and techniques in the cybersecurity industry. 

In the Cryptology section, I've included a link for each project that will lead you to my code, documentation, and video demos. These projects capture the encryption and decryption processes behind various algorithms.

I'm continuing to add to this as I further my education in the field of cybersecurity. If you wish to connect, feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/simonturnerud)!

# Cybersecurity

These are all of my projects that pertain to cybersecurity. 

## Home Lab Projects

Documenting the process of learning different tools and practices through a VM!

### [SIEM Lab](./siem-lab.md)
I created my own security operations center, utilizing Microsoft Azure and Sentinel to familiarize myself with detecting system traffic and security vulnerabilities.

### [Elastic Dashboard & Visualization Lab](./elastic-lab.md)
I configure different visualizations to illustrate various types of security incidents via the Kibana interface. I use KQL to query for incidents like failed logins, successful RDPs, etc.

### [Active Directory Lab](./active-directory-lab.md)
Here I'm able to get some hands-on experience and familiarity with Active Directory. I'm given a list of tasks and utilize Powershell and the AD GUI to accomplish them.

### [Network Enumeration Lab](./nmap-lab.md)
I'm given three tasks where I use 'nmap' to scan a target, having to bypass firewall rules and be as quiet or efficient as possible to not alert the IDS/IPS.

## Cryptology

These projects present encryption and decryption processes for several cryptology algorithms. All are coded in Python.

### [SHA-256](./sha-256.md)
SHA-256 encryptor, using hashlib documentation.

### [One-Time Pad](./one-time-pad.md)
Encryption with one-time pad algorithm.
Decryption of ciphertext2, when given plaintext1, ciphertext1 and ciphertext2.

### [Caesar Shift](./caesar-cryptology.md)
Rotation-based cypher.

### [Block Cipher](./block-cipher.md)
Encryption and decryption with the Cipher Block Chaining algorithm (CBC).

### [Mini SHA-256 Hash Cracker](./mini-sha256-hash-cracker.md)
Just an extra credit part to my midterm project in Databases & Computer Security. Given a random hash and password length, I'm asked to decrypt it.

# Mobile App Development

Miscellaneous projects that don't have much to do with cybersecurity, but rather me utilizing Dart and Flutter to implement functional apps with a GUI.

### [To-do App](./todo-app.md)

### [Personal Finance](./personal-finance.md)
